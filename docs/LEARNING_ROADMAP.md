# Learning Roadmap

Recommended path from beginner → advanced for Sruja.

## Beginner
- Quick Start: Install CLI and model your first system
- Concepts: Architecture DSL basics (systems, containers, components)
- Validation: Linting and common modeling mistakes
- Export: D2 diagrams and tree view

## Intermediate
- Relationships: Modeling flows and constraints
- Views: C4 levels and implied relationships
- Export: Markdown and HTML exports for docs
- Tooling: VS Code extension and Studio viewer

## Advanced
- Requirements: Functional, performance, security, constraints
- ADRs & Policies: Decision records and enforcement
- Operational: Failure modes, SLOs, DR, observability
- Extensibility: Custom exporters and validation rules

## Practice & Assessment
- Tutorials: Hands-on tasks aligned with each level
- Quizzes: Check understanding on key topics (`/quizzes/...`)
- Challenges: Small modeling exercises with automated checks (`/challenges/...`)

## How to Use This Roadmap
- Follow sections in order; skim ahead as needed
- After each section, complete one tutorial and one challenge
- Keep notes on decisions; consider writing an ADR for major choices

Tip: Prefer modeling real systems you know (e.g., a small web app) to make concepts stick.
