# Archive: Outdated and Completed Implementation Documents

This directory contains documents that are no longer part of the active implementation plan but are kept for historical reference.

## Archived Files

### Proposal Workflow (Removed)

These files document the proposal workflow that was removed in favor of using ADRs + external systems (GitHub PRs, Cloud Studio) for collaboration.

- `task-1.6-proposal-commands.md` - CLI commands for proposals (replaced by change commands)
- `task-4.6-proposals.md` - Visual proposals in Studio (replaced by task-4.6-changes.md)
- `teams-and-proposals.md` - Proposal workflow documentation (outdated)

**Reason for Removal**: Simplified workflow uses ADRs for decisions and external systems (GitHub PRs, Cloud Studio) for collaboration. No need for built-in proposal system.

**Replacement**: See `SIMPLIFIED_CHANGE_WORKFLOW.md` for the current approach.

### Export Enhancement (Completed)

Implementation planning and completion summaries for export enhancement features:

- `EXPORT_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md` - Original implementation plan
- `EXPORT_ENHANCEMENT_SUMMARY.md` - Completion summary

**Status**: All features completed and integrated into the codebase.

### Code Design Review Implementation (Completed)

Implementation summaries from code design review recommendations:

- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed implementation summary
- `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - Final completion confirmation

**Status**: All high and medium priority recommendations completed.

### Analysis and Review Documents (Completed)

Completed analysis and review documents:

- `TEST_COVERAGE_MIGRATION.md` - Test coverage summary for LikeC4 migration
- `WASM_BUILDER_SIZE_ANALYSIS.md` - Analysis of WASM size impact
- `WASM_COMMUNICATION_GAPS.md` - Review of WASM communication gaps

**Status**: Analysis complete, findings integrated or documented elsewhere.

### Future Planning and Vision Documents (Archived)

Long-term planning and vision documents that are not part of current active development:

- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Long-term plan for Integrated SDLC Intelligence Platform (future vision)
- `Future.md` - Research document on FAANG practices and future platform vision
- `CodeGen.md` - AI-assisted development pipeline requirements (not currently implemented)
- `RISK_DETECTION_FRAMEWORK.md` - Framework for future SDLC Intelligence Platform
- `FAANG_CAPABILITIES.md` - Marketing/positioning document about DSL capabilities

**Reason for Archival**: These documents describe future visions and long-term plans that are not part of current active development. They are kept for reference but should not be used for current implementation decisions.

### Investigation and Analysis Documents (Archived)

Temporary investigation and analysis documents:

- `BUILDER_API_USE_CASES.md` - Analysis of whether Builder API is needed
- `BUNDLE_SIZE_MONITORING.md` - Bundle size monitoring documentation (operational info, may be outdated)

- `LIKEC4_SRUJA_EXTENSIONS.md` - Documentation of Sruja extensions to LikeC4
- `LIKEC4_ARCHITECTURE.md` - LikeC4 architecture documentation

**Reason for Archival**: These are investigation/analysis documents that may be outdated or were created for specific investigations. They are kept for reference but may not reflect current state.

### Strategy and Design Documents (Archived)

Strategy and design documents that may be outdated:

- `PLATFORM_STRATEGY.md` - Platform strategy document
