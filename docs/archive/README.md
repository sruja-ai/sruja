# Archive: Outdated and Completed Implementation Documents

This directory contains documents that are no longer part of the active implementation plan but are kept for historical reference.

## Archived Files

### Proposal Workflow (Removed)

These files document the proposal workflow that was removed in favor of using ADRs + external systems (GitHub PRs, Cloud Studio) for collaboration.

- `task-1.6-proposal-commands.md` - CLI commands for proposals (replaced by change commands)
- `task-4.6-proposals.md` - Visual proposals in Studio (replaced by task-4.6-changes.md)
- `teams-and-proposals.md` - Proposal workflow documentation (outdated)

**Reason for Removal**: Simplified workflow uses ADRs for decisions and external systems (GitHub PRs, Cloud Studio) for collaboration. No need for built-in proposal system.

**Replacement**: See `SIMPLIFIED_CHANGE_WORKFLOW.md` for the current approach.

### Export Enhancement (Completed)

Implementation planning and completion summaries for export enhancement features:

- `EXPORT_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md` - Original implementation plan
- `EXPORT_ENHANCEMENT_SUMMARY.md` - Completion summary

**Status**: All features completed and integrated into the codebase.

### Code Design Review Implementation (Completed)

Implementation summaries from code design review recommendations:

- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed implementation summary
- `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - Final completion confirmation

**Status**: All high and medium priority recommendations completed.

### Analysis and Review Documents (Completed)

Completed analysis and review documents:
