# Your First Contribution to Sruja

## What is Sruja?

Sruja is an architecture-as-code language that helps you define and visualize software architectures. Think of it as a way to describe your system's structure in code, similar to how you might describe data structures.

### 2. 🐛 Testing & Bug Reports

- Test the website and report bugs
- Verify documentation accuracy

### 3. 💡 Examples
