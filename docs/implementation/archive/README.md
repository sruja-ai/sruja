# Archive: Outdated Implementation Documents

This directory contains documents that are no longer part of the active implementation plan but are kept for historical reference.

## Archived Files

### Proposal Workflow (Removed)

These files document the proposal workflow that was removed in favor of using ADRs + external systems (GitHub PRs, Cloud Studio) for collaboration.

- `task-1.6-proposal-commands.md` - CLI commands for proposals (replaced by change commands)
- `task-4.6-proposals.md` - Visual proposals in Studio (replaced by task-4.6-changes.md)
- `teams-and-proposals.md` - Proposal workflow documentation (outdated)

**Reason for Removal**: Simplified workflow uses ADRs for decisions and external systems (GitHub PRs, Cloud Studio) for collaboration. No need for built-in proposal system.

**Replacement**: See `SIMPLIFIED_CHANGE_WORKFLOW.md` for the current approach.

## Note

These files are kept for reference only. Do not use them for implementation.
