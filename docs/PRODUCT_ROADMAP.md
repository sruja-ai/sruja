# Sruja Product Roadmap

## Vision Statement

Transform Sruja from a static architecture visualization tool into a dynamic Integrated SDLC Intelligence Platform that continuously ingests data across the software development lifecycle, provides proactive risk detection, and delivers role-based insights to enable data-driven architectural decision-making.

## Product Strategy

### Core Differentiators

1. **Living Architecture Knowledge Graph**: Automatically maintained, always current
2. **Proactive Risk Detection**: Identify issues before they become incidents
3. **Role-Based Intelligence**: Tailored insights for every stakeholder
4. **Minimal Friction**: Automated data ingestion with minimal manual input
5. **What-If Analysis**: Simulate architectural changes before implementation

### Target Personas

- **CXO/Executive**: Strategic oversight, risk visibility, business impact
- **Architect**: System governance, design validation, technical debt management
- **Developer**: Service ownership, deployment health, incident context
- **SRE/DevOps**: Reliability monitoring, performance optimization, incident response
- **Product Manager**: Feature-to-architecture mapping, impact assessment

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to transforming Sruja into the comprehensive Integrated SDLC Intelligence Platform envisioned in the Future.md document. By following this phased approach, we can:

1. **Minimize Risk**: Incremental development with regular validation
2. **Maximize Value**: Focus on high-impact features first
3. **Ensure Adoption**: User-centric design with continuous feedback
4. **Enable Scale**: Architecture built for growth from day one
5. **Drive Success**: Clear metrics and accountability at every stage

The key to success will be maintaining focus on the core value proposition while building incrementally, listening to user feedback, and adapting to market needs. This roadmap provides the framework for that journey.
