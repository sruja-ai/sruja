**Pillars**: Sustainability

[← Back to Engines](../README.md)

## Overview

The Carbon Accounting Engine provides carbon footprint calculation, enabling comprehensive carbon accounting and tracking.

**This provides carbon accounting capabilities for sustainability.**

## Purpose

The Carbon Accounting Engine:

- ✅ Calculates carbon footprint
- ✅ Tracks carbon emissions
- ✅ Validates carbon targets
- ✅ Provides carbon recommendations
- ✅ Monitors carbon trends
- ✅ Generates carbon reports

### Direct Emissions
- Compute emissions
- Storage emissions
- Network emissions
- Infrastructure emissions

### Indirect Emissions
- Upstream emissions
- Downstream emissions
- Supply chain emissions
- Lifecycle emissions

### Scope Emissions
- Scope 1 (direct)
- Scope 2 (indirect - energy)
- Scope 3 (indirect - value chain)

## Carbon Factors

### Region Factors
- Regional carbon intensity
- Energy mix
- Grid carbon intensity
- Renewable energy availability

### Resource Factors
- Resource type carbon
- Instance type carbon
- Storage type carbon
- Network type carbon

### Time Factors
