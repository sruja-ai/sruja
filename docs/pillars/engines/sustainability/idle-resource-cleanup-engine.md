**Status**: Advanced Engine  
**Pillars**: Sustainability, Cost Optimization

[← Back to Engines](../README.md)

## Overview

The Idle Resource Cleanup Engine provides automatic resource cleanup, enabling waste reduction and cost optimization.

**This provides idle resource cleanup capabilities for sustainability and cost optimization.**

## Purpose

The Idle Resource Cleanup Engine:

- ✅ Detects idle resources
- ✅ Identifies unused resources
- ✅ Automatically cleans up resources
- ✅ Validates cleanup safety
- ✅ Tracks cleanup metrics
- ✅ Provides cleanup recommendations
- ✅ Generates cleanup reports

## Resource Types

### Compute Resources
- Idle instances
- Unused containers
- Stopped services
- Orphaned processes

### Storage Resources
- Unused volumes
- Orphaned snapshots
- Unused backups
- Temporary files

### Network Resources
- Unused load balancers
- Orphaned security groups
- Unused IP addresses
- Idle connections

### Database Resources
- Unused databases
- Orphaned connections
- Idle queries
- Unused indexes

## Cleanup Strategies

### Automatic Cleanup
- Immediate cleanup
- Scheduled cleanup
- Event-driven cleanup
- Threshold-based cleanup

### Safe Cleanup
- Safety validation
- Backup before cleanup
- Rollback capability
- Approval workflows

### Gradual Cleanup
- Phased cleanup
- Validated cleanup
- Monitored cleanup
- Progressive cleanup

## Integration Points

### Architecture-Time Observability Engine (ATOE)
- Uses usage data
- Detects idle resources

### Cost Optimization Engines
- Optimizes costs
- Reduces waste

### Architecture Sustainability Engine (ASE)
- Reduces waste
- Improves sustainability

### Resource Efficiency Engine
- Improves efficiency
- Reduces waste

## MCP API

```
cleanup.detect(resource)
cleanup.cleanup(resource)
cleanup.validate(resource)
cleanup.monitor(cleanup)
```

## Strategic Value
