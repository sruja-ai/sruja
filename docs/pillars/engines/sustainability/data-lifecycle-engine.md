# Data Lifecycle Engine

**Status**: Advanced Engine  
**Pillars**: Sustainability, Cost Optimization

[← Back to Engines](../README.md)

## Overview

The Data Lifecycle Engine provides hot/warm/cold data management, enabling optimal data lifecycle management for sustainability and cost.

**This provides data lifecycle capabilities for sustainability and cost optimization.**

## Purpose

The Data Lifecycle Engine:

- ✅ Manages data lifecycle
- ✅ Classifies data (hot/warm/cold)
- ✅ Optimizes data placement
- ✅ Automates data transitions
- ✅ Tracks lifecycle metrics
- ✅ Provides lifecycle recommendations
- ✅ Generates lifecycle reports

## Data Lifecycle Stages

### Hot Data
- Frequently accessed
- High-performance storage
- Low latency
- High cost

### Warm Data
- Occasionally accessed
- Standard storage
- Moderate latency
- Moderate cost

### Cold Data
- Rarely accessed
- Archive storage
- High latency
- Low cost

### Archive Data
- Long-term storage
- Deep archive
- Very high latency
- Very low cost

## Lifecycle Management

### Data Classification
- Access pattern analysis
- Usage frequency analysis
- Data age analysis
- Classification automation

### Data Transition
- Automatic transitions
- Scheduled transitions
- Policy-based transitions
- Cost-based transitions

### Data Optimization
- Storage optimization
- Cost optimization
- Performance optimization
- Sustainability optimization

## Integration Points

### Architecture Sustainability Engine (ASE)
- Uses lifecycle for sustainability
- Validates lifecycle targets

### Cost Optimization Engines
- Optimizes storage costs
- Manages lifecycle spending

### Architecture-Time Observability Engine (ATOE)
- Uses usage data
- Tracks lifecycle metrics

### Resource Efficiency Engine
- Improves efficiency
- Optimizes storage

## MCP API

```
lifecycle.classify(data)
lifecycle.transition(data, stage)
lifecycle.optimize(data)
lifecycle.monitor(data)
```

## Strategic Value

The Data Lifecycle Engine provides:

- ✅ Cost optimization
- ✅ Storage optimization
- ✅ Performance optimization
- ✅ Sustainability improvement

**This is critical for optimizing data storage costs and sustainability.**
