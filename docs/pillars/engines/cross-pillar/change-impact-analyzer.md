**Status**: Advanced Engine  
**Pillars**: Cross-Pillar (Operational Excellence, Reliability)

[← Back to Engines](../README.md)

## Overview

The Change Impact Analyzer assesses the impact of architecture changes, enabling informed decision-making and risk management.

**This provides change impact analysis for operational excellence and reliability.**

## Purpose

The Change Impact Analyzer:

- ✅ Assesses change impact
- ✅ Identifies affected components
- ✅ Predicts change consequences
- ✅ Evaluates change risks
- ✅ Provides impact reports
- ✅ Recommends mitigation strategies
- ✅ Tracks change history

## Impact Types

### Structural Impact
- Component changes
- Dependency changes
- Domain boundary changes
- Relationship changes

### Behavioral Impact
- API contract changes
- Event schema changes
- Flow changes
- Protocol changes

### Operational Impact
- Performance impact
- Reliability impact
- Cost impact
- Security impact

### Team Impact
- Team coordination
- Development effort
- Testing effort
- Deployment effort

## Impact Analysis

### Dependency Analysis
- Upstream dependencies
- Downstream dependencies
- Cross-domain dependencies
- External dependencies

### Risk Assessment
- Breaking change risk
- Performance risk
- Reliability risk
- Security risk

### Cost Assessment
- Development cost
- Infrastructure cost
- Operational cost
- Migration cost

## Integration Points

### Architecture Change Simulation
- Uses simulation for impact
- Validates impact predictions

### Architecture Impact Forecasting Engine (AIFE)
- Uses forecasting
- Predicts long-term impact

### Architecture Evolution Simulator (MAES)
- Simulates multi-system impact
- Predicts ecosystem impact

### Architecture Communication Hub (ACH)
- Notifies affected teams
- Communicates impact

## MCP API

```
impact.analyze(change)
impact.assess(component)
impact.predict(change)
impact.report(change)
```

## Strategic Value

The Change Impact Analyzer provides:

- ✅ Informed decision-making
- ✅ Risk management
- ✅ Impact prediction
- ✅ Team coordination

**This is critical for safe and effective architecture changes.**
