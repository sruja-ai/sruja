**Pillars**: Cross-Pillar (Risk Management)

[← Back to Engines](../README.md)

## Overview

The Risk Analysis Engine determines risk blast radius, enabling comprehensive risk analysis and impact assessment.

**This provides risk analysis capabilities for risk management.**

## Purpose

The Risk Analysis Engine:

- ✅ Determines risk blast radius
- ✅ Analyzes risk impact
- ✅ Identifies risk factors
- ✅ Provides risk recommendations
- ✅ Tracks risk trends
- ✅ Generates risk reports
- ✅ Supports risk mitigation

## Risk Analysis Types

### Blast Radius Analysis
- Failure impact radius
- Dependency impact radius
- Service impact radius
- System impact radius

### Risk Factor Analysis
- Structural risk factors
- Behavioral risk factors
- Operational risk factors
- Organizational risk factors

### Impact Analysis
- Business impact
- Technical impact
- Operational impact
- Financial impact

### Risk Propagation
- Risk propagation paths
- Cascading risk
- Risk amplification
- Risk mitigation paths

## Analysis Methods

### Graph-Based Analysis
- Dependency graph analysis
- Impact graph traversal
- Blast radius calculation
- Risk path identification

### Statistical Analysis
- Risk probability
- Risk severity
- Risk correlation
- Risk trends

### Scenario Analysis
- Failure scenarios
- Stress scenarios
- Change scenarios
- Migration scenarios

## Integration Points

### Risk Modeling & Impact Analysis Engine (RMIAE)
- Uses risk models
- Validates risk analysis

### Architecture-Time Observability Engine (ATOE)
- Uses observability data
- Tracks risk metrics

### Failure Propagation Engine (FPE)
- Uses failure propagation
- Models risk propagation

### Architecture Impact Forecasting Engine (AIFE)
- Forecasts risk impact
- Predicts risk consequences

## MCP API
