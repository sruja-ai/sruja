**Status**: Advanced Engine  
**Pillars**: Cross-Pillar (Governance, Best Practices)

[← Back to Engines](../README.md)

## Overview

The Technology Fit Engine matches technology choices to requirements, constraints, and use cases.

**This provides technology decision support and validation.**

## Purpose

The Technology Fit Engine:

- ✅ Matches tech to requirements
- ✅ Evaluates technology fit
- ✅ Recommends technology choices
- ✅ Validates technology decisions
- ✅ Assesses technology trade-offs
- ✅ Provides technology alternatives
- ✅ Tracks technology usage

## Evaluation Factors

### Functional Requirements
- Feature support
- Capability match
- Integration support
- Compatibility

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance characteristics
- Scalability limits
- Reliability features
- Security capabilities

### Constraints
- Cost constraints
- License constraints
- Team expertise
- Infrastructure requirements

### Trade-offs
- Performance vs cost
- Complexity vs flexibility
