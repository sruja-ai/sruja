- Dependency explanations
- Relationship clarifications
- Pattern descriptions

### Behavioral Explanations
- Flow descriptions
- Interaction explanations
- Event flow narratives
- Process descriptions

### Decision Explanations
- ADR explanations
- Design rationale
- Trade-off descriptions
- Alternative explanations

### Context Explanations
- Domain context
- Business context
- Technical context
- Historical context

## Explanation Methods

### Natural Language Generation
- Narrative generation
- Description creation
- Question answering
- Summarization

### Visual Explanations
- Diagram annotations
