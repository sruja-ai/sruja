**Status**: Advanced Engine  
**Pillars**: Security

[← Back to Engines](../README.md)

## Overview

The Vulnerability Detection Engine provides security vulnerability scanning, enabling proactive vulnerability detection and remediation.

**This provides vulnerability detection capabilities for security.**

## Purpose

The Vulnerability Detection Engine:

- ✅ Scans for vulnerabilities
- ✅ Detects security weaknesses
- ✅ Identifies vulnerability patterns
- ✅ Provides remediation recommendations
- ✅ Tracks vulnerability status
- ✅ Generates vulnerability reports
- ✅ Supports vulnerability management

## Vulnerability Types

### Code Vulnerabilities
- Code security issues
- Injection vulnerabilities
- Authentication vulnerabilities
- Authorization vulnerabilities

### Configuration Vulnerabilities
- Misconfiguration
- Insecure defaults
- Missing security controls
- Policy violations

### Dependency Vulnerabilities
- Dependency vulnerabilities
- Outdated dependencies
- Known vulnerabilities
- Supply chain vulnerabilities

### Infrastructure Vulnerabilities
- Infrastructure misconfiguration
- Network vulnerabilities
- Storage vulnerabilities
- Compute vulnerabilities

## Detection Methods

### Static Analysis
- Code analysis
- Configuration analysis
- Policy analysis
- Pattern analysis

### Dynamic Analysis
- Runtime scanning
- Behavior analysis
- Traffic analysis
- Performance analysis

### Dependency Scanning
- Dependency analysis
- Vulnerability database
- CVE scanning
- Package scanning

### Infrastructure Scanning
- Infrastructure analysis
- Network scanning
- Configuration scanning
- Compliance scanning

## Integration Points

### Security Validation Engine
- Uses detection for validation
- Validates security controls

### Architecture Threat Modeling Engine (ATME)
- Uses vulnerabilities for threat modeling
- Validates security controls

### Architecture-Time Observability Engine (ATOE)
- Uses observability data
- Tracks vulnerability metrics

### Architecture Governance Engine (AGE)
- Enforces governance
- Validates security policies

## MCP API

```
vulnerability.scan(service)
vulnerability.detect(component)
vulnerability.remediate(vulnerability)
vulnerability.report(service)
```

## Strategic Value

The Vulnerability Detection Engine provides:

- ✅ Proactive security
- ✅ Vulnerability identification
- ✅ Risk mitigation
- ✅ Security improvement

**This is critical for identifying and remediating security vulnerabilities.**
