**Pillars**: Security

[← Back to Engines](../README.md)

## Overview

The Security Validation Engine provides security policy enforcement, ensuring architectural compliance with security requirements.

**This provides security validation capabilities for security.**

## Purpose

The Security Validation Engine:

- ✅ Enforces security policies
- ✅ Validates security configuration
- ✅ Detects security violations
- ✅ Provides security recommendations
- ✅ Tracks security compliance
- ✅ Generates security reports
- ✅ Supports security governance

## Validation Types

### Authentication Validation
- Authentication requirements
- Authentication methods
- Multi-factor authentication
- Identity verification

### Authorization Validation
- Access control validation
- Permission validation
- Role-based access
- Policy-based access

### Encryption Validation
- Data encryption requirements
- Encryption at rest
- Encryption in transit
- Key management

### Network Security Validation
- Network segmentation
- Firewall rules
- Security groups
- VPC configuration

## Security Policies

### Data Protection Policies
- PII protection
- PCI-DSS compliance
- GDPR compliance
- Data encryption policies

### Access Control Policies
- Least privilege
- Zero trust
- Role-based access
- Time-based access

### Network Security Policies
- Network isolation
- Secure communication
- VPN requirements
- Network monitoring

## Integration Points

### Architecture Threat Modeling Engine (ATME)
- Uses threat models
- Validates security controls

### Architecture Governance Engine (AGE)
- Enforces governance
- Validates policies

### Architecture-Time Observability Engine (ATOE)
- Uses observability data
- Tracks security metrics

### Architecture Compliance Score Engine (ACSE)
- Uses security for scoring
- Validates compliance

## MCP API

```
security.validate(config)
security.policy(policy)
security.compliance(service)
security.report(service)
```

## Strategic Value
