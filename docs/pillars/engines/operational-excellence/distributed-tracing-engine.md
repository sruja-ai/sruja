# Distributed Tracing Engine

**Status**: Advanced Engine  
**Pillars**: Operational Excellence

[← Back to Engines](../README.md)

## Overview

The Distributed Tracing Engine provides request tracing across services, enabling end-to-end request flow visibility.

**This provides distributed tracing capabilities for operational excellence.**

## Purpose

The Distributed Tracing Engine:

- ✅ Traces requests across services
- ✅ Provides trace visualization
- ✅ Enables trace analysis
- ✅ Supports trace correlation
- ✅ Tracks trace performance
- ✅ Identifies trace bottlenecks
- ✅ Generates trace insights

## Trace Features

### Request Tracing
- End-to-end request flow
- Service-to-service calls
- Cross-boundary traces
- Async event traces

### Trace Analysis
- Latency analysis
- Error analysis
- Dependency analysis
- Performance analysis

### Trace Visualization
- Trace timeline
- Service map
- Dependency graph
- Performance heatmap

## Integration Points

### Architecture-Time Observability Engine (ATOE)
- Uses traces for observability
- Correlates traces with metrics

### Architecture Runtime Conformance Engine (ARCE)
- Validates trace patterns
- Checks trace compliance

### Architecture Change Simulation
- Uses traces for simulation
- Validates trace predictions

### Architecture Evolution Knowledge Graph (AEKG)
- Stores trace patterns
- Tracks trace trends

## MCP API

```
trace.request(requestId)
trace.analyze(traceId)
trace.visualize(traceId)
trace.correlate(traces)
```

## Strategic Value

The Distributed Tracing Engine provides:

- ✅ End-to-end visibility
- ✅ Request flow tracking
- ✅ Performance analysis
- ✅ Troubleshooting support

**This is critical for understanding distributed system behavior.**
