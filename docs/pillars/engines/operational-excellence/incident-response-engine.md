**Status**: Advanced Engine  
**Pillars**: Operational Excellence

[← Back to Engines](../README.md)

## Overview

The Incident Response Engine provides automated incident handling, enabling rapid and effective incident response.

**This provides automated incident response for operational excellence.**

## Purpose

The Incident Response Engine:

- ✅ Detects incidents
- ✅ Classifies incidents
- ✅ Routes incidents
- ✅ Coordinates response
- ✅ Executes response procedures
- ✅ Tracks incident resolution
- ✅ Generates incident reports

## Incident Types

### Service Incidents
- Service failures
- Performance degradation
- Availability issues
- Error rate spikes

### Infrastructure Incidents
- Infrastructure failures
- Network issues
- Resource exhaustion
- Configuration errors

### Security Incidents
- Security breaches
- Unauthorized access
- Data breaches
- Compliance violations

### Data Incidents
- Data loss
- Data corruption
- Data inconsistency
- Backup failures

## Response Process

### Detection
- Alert-based detection
- Metric-based detection
- Log-based detection
- Manual detection

### Classification
- Severity classification
- Priority classification
- Category classification
- Impact assessment

### Response
- Automated response
- Runbook execution
- Team notification
- Escalation

### Resolution
- Incident resolution
- Validation
- Documentation
- Post-mortem

## Integration Points

### Alerting Engine
- Receives alerts
- Triggers incident response

### Runbook Engine
- Executes runbooks
- Automates response

### Architecture-Time Observability Engine (ATOE)
- Uses observability data
- Monitors incident status

### Architecture Communication Hub (ACH)
- Notifies teams
- Coordinates response

### Incident Propagation Simulator
- Predicts incident impact
- Models incident propagation

## MCP API

```
incident.detect(alert)
incident.classify(incident)
incident.route(incident, team)
incident.resolve(incident)
incident.report(incident)
```

## Strategic Value

The Incident Response Engine provides:

- ✅ Rapid incident response
- ✅ Automated handling
- ✅ Team coordination
- ✅ Incident tracking

**This is critical for operational excellence and reliability.**
