# Logging Aggregation Engine

**Status**: Advanced Engine  
**Pillars**: Operational Excellence

[← Back to Engines](../README.md)

## Overview

The Logging Aggregation Engine provides centralized logging aggregation and analysis for architecture monitoring.

**This provides unified logging capabilities for operational excellence.**

## Purpose

The Logging Aggregation Engine:

- ✅ Aggregates logs from services
- ✅ Centralizes log storage
- ✅ Provides log search
- ✅ Enables log analysis
- ✅ Supports log correlation
- ✅ Tracks log patterns
- ✅ Generates log insights

## Log Sources

### Application Logs
- Service logs
- API logs
- Business logic logs
- Error logs

### Infrastructure Logs
- Container logs
- Orchestrator logs
- Network logs
- System logs

### Security Logs
- Authentication logs
- Authorization logs
- Access logs
- Audit logs

## Integration Points

### Architecture-Time Observability Engine (ATOE)
- Uses logs for observability
- Correlates logs with metrics

### Architecture Runtime Conformance Engine (ARCE)
- Validates log patterns
- Checks log compliance

### Alerting Engine
- Uses logs for alerts
- Triggers on log patterns

### Architecture Evolution Knowledge Graph (AEKG)
- Stores log patterns
- Tracks log trends

## MCP API

```
logs.aggregate(source)
logs.search(query, timeRange)
logs.analyze(pattern)
logs.correlate(logs)
```

## Strategic Value

The Logging Aggregation Engine provides:

- ✅ Centralized logging
- ✅ Log analysis
- ✅ Operational insights
- ✅ Troubleshooting support

**This is critical for comprehensive observability and debugging.**
