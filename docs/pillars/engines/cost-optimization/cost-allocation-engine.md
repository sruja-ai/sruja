# Cost Allocation Engine

**Status**: Advanced Engine  
**Pillars**: Cost Optimization

[← Back to Engines](../README.md)

## Overview

The Cost Allocation Engine provides team and project cost allocation, enabling cost attribution and accountability.

**This provides cost allocation capabilities for cost optimization.**

## Purpose

The Cost Allocation Engine:

- ✅ Allocates costs to teams
- ✅ Allocates costs to projects
- ✅ Provides cost attribution
- ✅ Tracks cost ownership
- ✅ Generates allocation reports
- ✅ Supports cost accountability
- ✅ Enables chargeback/showback

## Allocation Methods

### Direct Allocation
- Direct cost assignment
- Resource ownership
- Service ownership
- Project ownership

### Proportional Allocation
- Usage-based allocation
- Resource-based allocation
- Time-based allocation
- Activity-based allocation

### Tag-Based Allocation
- Cost tag allocation
- Resource tag allocation
- Service tag allocation
- Custom tag allocation

### Shared Cost Allocation
- Shared resource allocation
- Common cost allocation
- Infrastructure allocation
- Platform allocation

## Allocation Dimensions

### Team Allocation
- Team cost attribution
- Department allocation
- Cost center allocation
- Organization allocation

### Project Allocation
- Project cost attribution
- Initiative allocation
- Feature allocation
- Product allocation

### Service Allocation
- Service cost attribution
- Component allocation
- Domain allocation
- System allocation

## Integration Points

### Cost Analysis Engine
- Uses cost data
- Provides allocation data

### Cost Modeling & Optimization Engine (CMOE)
- Uses cost models
- Validates allocations

### Architecture-Time Observability Engine (ATOE)
- Uses usage data
- Tracks allocation metrics

### Architecture Goals Engine
- Aligns with business goals
- Tracks cost goals

## MCP API

```
allocation.allocate(cost, dimension)
allocation.team(team)
allocation.project(project)
allocation.report(dimension)
```

## Strategic Value

The Cost Allocation Engine provides:

- ✅ Cost attribution
- ✅ Cost accountability
- ✅ Chargeback/showback
- ✅ Cost governance

**This is critical for cost accountability and FinOps practices.**

## Implementation Status
