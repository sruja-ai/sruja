**Status**: Advanced Engine  
**Pillars**: Cost Optimization

[← Back to Engines](../README.md)

## Overview

The Reserved Instance Engine provides RI planning and optimization, enabling cost savings through reserved instance strategies.

**This provides reserved instance capabilities for cost optimization.**

## Purpose

The Reserved Instance Engine:

- ✅ Plans reserved instances
- ✅ Optimizes RI purchases
- ✅ Validates RI strategies
- ✅ Tracks RI utilization
- ✅ Provides RI recommendations
- ✅ Monitors RI savings
- ✅ Generates RI reports

## RI Types

### Standard RIs
- Standard reserved instances
- 1-3 year terms
- All upfront payment
- Partial upfront payment
- No upfront payment

### Convertible RIs
- Convertible reserved instances
- Instance type flexibility
- Exchange capability
- Upgrade capability

### Scheduled RIs
- Scheduled reserved instances
- Time-based scheduling
- Recurring reservations
- Event-based reservations

## RI Planning

### Usage Analysis
