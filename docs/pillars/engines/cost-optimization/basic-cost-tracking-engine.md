# Basic Cost Tracking Engine

**Status**: Core Engine  
**Pillars**: Cost Optimization

[← Back to Engines](../README.md)

## Overview

The Basic Cost Tracking Engine provides cost estimate validation, ensuring services define and validate cost estimates.

**This provides basic cost tracking capabilities for cost optimization.**

## Purpose

The Basic Cost Tracking Engine:

- ✅ Validates cost estimates
- ✅ Checks cost configuration
- ✅ Validates cost requirements
- ✅ Provides cost recommendations
- ✅ Supports basic cost monitoring

## Cost Estimates

### Service Cost Estimates
- Service cost validation
- Service cost configuration
- Service cost thresholds
- Service cost recommendations

### Resource Cost Estimates
- Resource cost validation
- Resource cost configuration
- Resource cost thresholds
- Resource cost recommendations

### Infrastructure Cost Estimates
- Infrastructure cost validation
- Infrastructure cost configuration
- Infrastructure cost thresholds
- Infrastructure cost recommendations

## Validation Rules

### Estimate Validation
- Cost estimate exists
- Cost estimate is valid
- Cost estimate is reasonable
- Cost estimate is consistent

### Configuration Validation
- Cost thresholds are valid
- Cost thresholds are reasonable
- Cost thresholds are consistent
- Cost thresholds are achievable

## Integration Points

### Cost Analysis Engine (Advanced)
- Extends basic functionality
- Provides advanced features

### FinOps Engine
- Uses cost estimates
- Tracks cost metrics

### Validation Engine
- Uses validation rules
- Provides error reporting

## MCP API

```
cost.basic.validate(service)
cost.basic.estimate(service)
cost.basic.recommend(service)
```

## Strategic Value

The Basic Cost Tracking Engine provides:

- ✅ Cost validation
- ✅ Basic cost monitoring
- ✅ Cost awareness
- ✅ Budget management

**This is essential for basic cost optimization.**
