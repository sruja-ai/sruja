# Basic Latency Engine

**Status**: Core Engine  
**Pillars**: Performance Efficiency

[← Back to Engines](../README.md)

## Overview

The Basic Latency Engine provides latency target validation, ensuring services define and validate latency requirements.

**This provides basic latency capabilities for performance efficiency.**

## Purpose

The Basic Latency Engine:

- ✅ Validates latency targets
- ✅ Checks latency configuration
- ✅ Validates latency requirements
- ✅ Provides latency recommendations
- ✅ Supports basic performance monitoring

## Latency Targets

### Request Latency
- Request latency target validation
- Request latency configuration
- Request latency thresholds
- Request latency recommendations

### Response Latency
- Response latency target validation
- Response latency configuration
- Response latency thresholds
- Response latency recommendations

### End-to-End Latency
- End-to-end latency target validation
- End-to-end latency configuration
- End-to-end latency thresholds
- End-to-end latency recommendations

## Validation Rules

### Target Validation
- Latency target exists
- Latency target is valid
- Latency target is reasonable
- Latency target is consistent

### Configuration Validation
- Latency thresholds are valid
- Latency thresholds are reasonable
- Latency thresholds are consistent
- Latency thresholds are achievable

## Integration Points

### Latency Analysis Engine (Advanced)
- Extends basic functionality
- Provides advanced features

### Performance Engine
- Uses latency targets
- Tracks latency metrics

### Validation Engine
- Uses validation rules
- Provides error reporting

## MCP API
