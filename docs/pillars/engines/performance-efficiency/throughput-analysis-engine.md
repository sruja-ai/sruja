# Throughput Analysis Engine

**Status**: Advanced Engine  
**Pillars**: Performance Efficiency

[← Back to Engines](../README.md)

## Overview

The Throughput Analysis Engine provides RPS, QPS, TPS analysis, enabling comprehensive throughput monitoring and optimization.

**This provides throughput analysis capabilities for performance efficiency.**

## Purpose

The Throughput Analysis Engine:

- ✅ Analyzes RPS (requests per second)
- ✅ Analyzes QPS (queries per second)
- ✅ Analyzes TPS (transactions per second)
- ✅ Tracks throughput trends
- ✅ Identifies throughput bottlenecks
- ✅ Provides throughput recommendations
- ✅ Validates throughput targets

## Throughput Metrics

### Request Throughput
- Requests per second
- Requests per minute
- Requests per hour
- Peak throughput

### Query Throughput
- Queries per second
- Database queries
- Cache queries
- Search queries

### Transaction Throughput
- Transactions per second
- Business transactions
- Financial transactions
- Data transactions

### Event Throughput
- Events per second
- Messages per second
- Events processed
- Event processing rate

## Analysis Methods

### Time-Series Analysis
- Throughput trends
- Throughput patterns
- Throughput spikes
- Throughput degradation

### Capacity Analysis
- Current capacity
- Peak capacity
- Capacity utilization
- Capacity limits

### Bottleneck Analysis
- Throughput bottlenecks
- Resource constraints
- Dependency limits
- Optimization opportunities

## Integration Points

### Architecture-Time Observability Engine (ATOE)
- Uses observability data

### Performance Engine
- Uses throughput for performance
- Validates throughput targets

### Capacity Planning Engine
- Uses throughput for planning
- Forecasts capacity needs

### Autoscaling Engine
- Uses throughput for scaling
- Triggers scaling based on throughput

## MCP API

```
throughput.analyze(service, timeRange)
throughput.metrics(service)
throughput.trends(service)
throughput.bottlenecks(service)
```

## Strategic Value
