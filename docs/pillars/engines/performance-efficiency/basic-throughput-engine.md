# Basic Throughput Engine

**Status**: Core Engine  
**Pillars**: Performance Efficiency

[← Back to Engines](../README.md)

## Overview

The Basic Throughput Engine provides throughput target checks, ensuring services define and validate throughput requirements.

**This provides basic throughput capabilities for performance efficiency.**

## Purpose

The Basic Throughput Engine:

- ✅ Validates throughput targets
- ✅ Checks throughput configuration
- ✅ Validates throughput requirements
- ✅ Provides throughput recommendations
- ✅ Supports basic performance monitoring

## Throughput Targets

### Request Throughput
- Requests per second (RPS)
- Request throughput target validation
- Request throughput configuration
- Request throughput thresholds

### Query Throughput
- Queries per second (QPS)
- Query throughput target validation
- Query throughput configuration
- Query throughput thresholds

### Transaction Throughput
- Transactions per second (TPS)
- Transaction throughput target validation
- Transaction throughput configuration
- Transaction throughput thresholds

## Validation Rules

### Target Validation
- Throughput target exists
- Throughput target is valid
- Throughput target is reasonable
- Throughput target is consistent

### Configuration Validation
- Throughput thresholds are valid
- Throughput thresholds are reasonable
- Throughput thresholds are consistent
- Throughput thresholds are achievable

## Integration Points

### Throughput Analysis Engine (Advanced)
- Extends basic functionality
- Provides advanced features

### Performance Engine
- Uses throughput targets
- Tracks throughput metrics

### Validation Engine
- Uses validation rules
- Provides error reporting

## MCP API

```
throughput.basic.validate(service)
