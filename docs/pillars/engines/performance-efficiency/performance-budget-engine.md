- Event budget

### Cost Budgets
- Performance cost budget
- Resource cost budget
- Optimization cost budget
- Infrastructure cost budget

## Budget Management

### Budget Allocation
- Budget distribution
- Budget assignment
- Budget sharing
- Budget limits

### Budget Tracking
- Real-time tracking
