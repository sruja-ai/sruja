# UI & Future Features

This folder contains documentation for future UI features and web-based tools.

**Current Focus:** Go CLI tool and language implementation  
**Future:** Web UI for viewing and collaborating on architecture

## Contents

- **LSP Architecture** - Language Server Protocol for future editor integration
- **Tech Stack (UI)** - React/Next.js technology stack for future UI
- **Tech Stack (Specs)** - Complete tech stack from specifications
- **Implementation Plan** - Original implementation plan with UI phases
- **Phase Tasks** - Detailed UI implementation tasks

## Status

These features are **planned for future phases** after the core Go CLI tool is complete.

The Go CLI tool will:
- Parse DSL files
- Generate Mermaid diagrams
- Validate architecture
- Export to various formats

The future UI will build on top of the Go CLI, using it as a backend service.
