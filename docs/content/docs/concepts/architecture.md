# Architecture

The `architecture` block is the root element of any Sruja model. It represents the entire scope of what you are modeling.

## Syntax

```sruja
architecture "My System Name" {
    // ... define systems, persons, etc. here
}
```

## Purpose

-   **Scope Boundary**: Everything inside is part of the model.
-   **Naming**: Gives a name to the overall architecture.
