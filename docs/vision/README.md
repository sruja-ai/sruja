# Vision & Strategy Documentation

This section contains the vision, requirements, market analysis, and strategic direction for Sruja.

## Documents

- **[Requirements](./requirements.md)** - Core vision and key requirements
- **[Tool Comparison](./tool-comparison.md)** - Analysis of existing tools and best ideas to incorporate
- **[Governance & Approval](./governance.md)** - Architecture governance and approval process features
- **[Business Strategy](./business-strategy.md)** - Market opportunity, business models, and go-to-market strategy

## Overview

Sruja is a **bidirectional, code-driven architecture modeling system** that serves as the single source of truth for software architecture—from abstract intent to concrete implementation.

### Key Differentiators

1. **True Two-Way Sync** - UI (diagram) ⇄ DSL (code) perfectly synchronized
2. **Multi-Layer Abstraction** - VHLD → HLD → LLD support
3. **MCP Integration** - Exposes architecture context to AI assistants
4. **Git-Native** - Plain text DSL, diffable and mergeable
5. **Component Libraries** - Versioned, reusable architectural templates
6. **Governance Features** - Approval workflows, validation, best practices

### Target Market

- **Enterprise Architecture Teams** - Need governance and compliance
- **Development Teams** - Want architecture-as-code workflows
- **AI-Assisted Development** - Require machine-readable architecture models
- **Learning Platforms** - Architecture education and community
