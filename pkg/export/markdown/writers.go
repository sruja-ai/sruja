// This file is intentionally left empty as its contents have been distributed to:
// - writers_structure.go (System, Person, Relations)
// - writers_content.go (Overview, Metadata, Stats, TOC, Glossary)
// - writers_extensions.go (Requirements, ADRs, Scenarios, Best Practices)
//
// We keep it temporarily to avoid breaking builds if any other file imports it (though they shouldn't).
// It can be safely deleted in the future if confirmed unused.
