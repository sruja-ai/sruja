// This file is intentionally left empty as its contents have been distributed to:
// - converters_structure.go (System, Container, Component, Person, etc.)
// - converters_extensions.go (SLO, policies, etc.)
//
// We keep it temporarily to avoid breaking builds if any other file tests against it (though implementation is moved).
// It can be safely deleted in the future if confirmed unused.
