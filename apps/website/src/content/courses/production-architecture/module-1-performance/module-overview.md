# Module Overview: Scaling & Performance Interview Questions

**"Design a system that handles 10 million concurrent users."**

This is one of the most common system design interview questions. In this module, you'll learn how to answer scaling and performance questions confidently.

## Interview Questions You'll Master

- "Design a video streaming platform like YouTube/Netflix"
- "How would you design a system to handle 10M concurrent users?"
- "Design a system with < 200ms latency"
- "How do you ensure high availability (99.99%)?"

## What Interviewers Look For

- ✅ Understanding of horizontal vs vertical scaling
- ✅ Ability to estimate capacity and scale
- ✅ Knowledge of performance metrics (latency, throughput)
- ✅ Trade-off analysis (cost vs performance)
- ✅ Clear communication of your design

## Goals

- Answer scaling questions with confidence
- Use `scale` blocks to model auto-scaling strategies
- Define SLOs to show production-ready thinking
- Explain trade-offs clearly to interviewers

## Interview Framework

We'll follow this approach for each question:
1. **Clarify Requirements** - Ask about scale, latency, availability
2. **Design High-Level** - Start with core components
3. **Model with Sruja** - Visualize your architecture
4. **Discuss Scaling** - Show how it handles load
5. **Optimize** - Improve based on constraints

## Estimated Time

60-75 minutes (includes practice)

## Checklist

- [ ] Understand how to approach scaling questions
- [ ] Model scaling strategies with Sruja
- [ ] Define SLOs to show production thinking
- [ ] Practice explaining trade-offs clearly
