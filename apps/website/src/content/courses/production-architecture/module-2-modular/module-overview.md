# Module Overview: Microservices & Distributed Systems Interview Questions

**"Design an e-commerce platform using microservices."**

This is a **very common interview question** that tests your understanding of:
- Microservices architecture
- Service decomposition
- Inter-service communication
- Distributed system challenges

## Interview Questions You'll Master

- "Design an e-commerce platform (Amazon-style)"
- "Design a ride-sharing service like Uber"
- "Design a social media platform"
- "How do you split a monolith into microservices?"

## What Interviewers Look For

- ✅ Understanding of microservices vs monolith trade-offs
- ✅ Ability to decompose a system into services
- ✅ Knowledge of service communication patterns
- ✅ Understanding of distributed system challenges
- ✅ Clear communication of design decisions

## Goals

- Answer microservices questions confidently
- Model service boundaries using separate systems in Sruja
- Explain service decomposition strategy
- Discuss trade-offs and challenges

## Interview Framework

We'll follow this approach:
1. **Clarify Requirements** - Scale, features, constraints
2. **Identify Services** - How to decompose the system
3. **Model with Sruja** - Use separate systems to show service boundaries
4. **Discuss Communication** - APIs, events, data flow
5. **Address Challenges** - Consistency, failures, monitoring

## Estimated Time

60-75 minutes (includes practice)

## Checklist

- [ ] Understand microservices decomposition
- [ ] Model services as separate systems in Sruja
- [ ] Explain service communication patterns
- [ ] Discuss distributed system challenges
