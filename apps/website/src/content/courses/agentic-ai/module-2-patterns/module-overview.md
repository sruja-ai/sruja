# Agentic Patterns

Single-loop agents are powerful, but complex tasks often require structured patterns or multiple agents working together.

## Learning Objectives

1.  **Understand ReAct**: The foundational pattern of Reason + Act.
2.  **Explore Multi-Agent Systems**: How agents collaborate.
3.  **Model Orchestration**: Supervisor vs. Hierarchical flows.
