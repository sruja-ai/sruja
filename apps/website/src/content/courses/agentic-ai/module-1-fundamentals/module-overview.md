# Fundamentals of Agentic AI

Welcome to the first module of the Agentic AI Architecture course. In this module, we will explore what makes an AI system "agentic" and how to model its components using Sruja.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1.  **Define Agentic AI**: Understand the difference between passive LLM calls and autonomous agents.
2.  **Identify Core Components**: Recognize Agents, Tools, Memory, and Planning modules.
3.  **Model Basic Agents**: Use Sruja to represent a simple agent with tools.
