# Modeling Agents in Sruja

In this final module, we will bring everything together and learn the best practices for modeling agentic systems in Sruja.

## Learning Objectives

1.  **Granularity**: Deciding when to model an agent as a System, Container, or Component.
2.  **Metadata**: Using tags to track models, costs, and latency.
3.  **Governance**: Defining policies for AI safety.
