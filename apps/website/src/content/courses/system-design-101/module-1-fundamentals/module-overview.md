# Module 1: Fundamentals

> [!TIP]
> **The Interview Secret**: Most candidates fail not because they don't know the tech, but because they **dive into solutions too early**. This module fixes that.

## What's Inside?

This isn't just theory. It's the playbook for how senior engineers approach broad, ambiguous problems.

1.  **[What is System Design?](./lesson-1)**: Defining the game we're playing.
2.  **The Art of Requirements**: How to extract the *real* problem from a vague prompt.
3.  **The C4 Model**: A standardized way to draw your ideas so others actually understand them.
4.  **Trade-offs**: Why "it depends" is the only correct answer (and how to explain *what* it depends on).
5.  **Sruja Basics**: Your first architecture-as-code model.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

-   ✅ **Distinguish** between Functional and Non-Functional Requirements.
-   ✅ **Calculate** rough capacity estimates (back-of-the-envelope math).
-   ✅ **Draw** a high-level System Context diagram.
-   ✅ **Explain** the CAP theorem in plain English.
