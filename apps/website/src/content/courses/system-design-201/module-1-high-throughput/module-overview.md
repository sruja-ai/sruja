# Module Overview: High Throughput Systems

**"Design a system that handles 1 million requests per second."**

This module covers advanced scaling patterns needed for high-throughput systems - a common interview topic at top tech companies.

## Learning Goals

- Identify throughput bottlenecks in systems
- Apply scaling patterns (queues, sharding, caching)
- Model trade-offs and document decisions with ADRs
- Design systems that handle massive scale

## Interview Preparation

- ✅ Answer "design for high throughput" questions
- ✅ Explain queuing and async processing
- ✅ Discuss database sharding strategies
- ✅ Model scaling patterns with Sruja

## Real-World Application

- Design systems that handle millions of requests
- Apply patterns to actual high-scale systems
- Understand trade-offs in scaling decisions

## Estimated Time

60-75 minutes (includes practice)

## Checklist

- [ ] Can identify throughput bottlenecks
- [ ] Understand queuing and async patterns
- [ ] Can design sharding strategies
- [ ] Can explain trade-offs clearly
