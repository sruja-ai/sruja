# System Design 201: Advanced Systems

## Overview
- Focuses on scaling strategies and production realities beyond fundamentals
- Covers throughput, real-time processing, data-intensive architectures, and consistency models

## Learning Goals
- Design services for high throughput and predictable performance
- Apply real-time processing patterns for streaming data
- Architect data-intensive systems with storage and compute separation
- Choose appropriate consistency and isolation models (and know the trade-offs)

## Prerequisites
- Completed or familiar with concepts from System Design 101
- Comfortable with distributed systems basics, caching, queues, and storage types

## Course Structure
- Module 1: High Throughput
- Module 2: Real-Time
- Module 3: Data-Intensive
- Module 4: Consistency

## Where to Start
- Begin with Module 1 to build scaling foundations, then proceed in order
