# Module Overview: Policy as Code

**Turn architectural standards into executable code that runs in CI/CD.**

This module teaches you how to write architectural policies as code, enforce them automatically, and scale governance across large organizations.

## Learning Goals

- Write constraints and conventions in Sruja
- Enforce layer boundaries and service dependencies
- Prevent architectural violations in CI/CD
- Track compliance across services and teams

## Why Policy as Code?

**Traditional approach:**
- Manual code reviews
- Architecture decision documents (ADRs) that get outdated
- Inconsistent enforcement across teams
- Compliance audits are manual and risky

**Policy as Code approach:**
- Automated validation in CI/CD
- Policies version-controlled with code
- Consistent enforcement across all teams
- Compliance reports generated automatically

## What You'll Build

By the end of this module, you'll have:

- ✅ A policy file that enforces architectural standards
- ✅ CI/CD integration that blocks violations
- ✅ Compliance tracking across services
- ✅ Patterns you can apply to your organization

## Estimated Time

**5 minutes** — Quick, focused lessons.

## Prerequisites

- Basic Sruja syntax (see [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started))
- Familiarity with CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
- Understanding of architectural governance challenges

## Checklist

- [ ] Understand how to write constraints
- [ ] Know how to enforce conventions
- [ ] Can integrate policies into CI/CD
- [ ] Can track compliance across services
