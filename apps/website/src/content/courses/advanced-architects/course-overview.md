# Quick Start for Seasoned Software Architects

**For senior architects who need to enforce standards across large organizations.**

This 5-minute course teaches you how to use Sruja to codify architectural policies, prevent drift, and scale governance across multiple teams—without slowing down development.

## Why This Course?

As organizations grow, architectural standards become critical but hard to enforce. This course shows you how to:

- ✅ **Codify policies** as executable rules
- ✅ **Prevent architectural drift** automatically
- ✅ **Scale governance** across 100+ engineers
- ✅ **Enforce standards** in CI/CD without manual reviews
- ✅ **Track compliance** across services and teams

## What You'll Learn

- **Policy as Code**: Write architectural rules that run in CI/CD
- **Constraint Enforcement**: Prevent violations before they reach production
- **Governance Patterns**: Real-world patterns for large organizations
- **Compliance Automation**: Track and report on architectural compliance
- **Team Scaling**: How to roll out governance without friction

## Who This Course Is For

- Senior/staff architects leading multiple teams
- Engineering managers responsible for architectural standards
- Platform teams building developer tooling
- Architects at companies with 50+ engineers
- Anyone implementing architecture governance

## Prerequisites

- Experience with software architecture at scale
- Familiarity with CI/CD pipelines
- Basic understanding of Sruja syntax (or complete [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) first)

## Estimated Time

**5 minutes** — Quick, actionable lessons you can apply immediately.

## Course Structure

### Module 1: Policy as Code (5 minutes)
Learn to codify architectural standards as executable policies that run in CI/CD.

**You'll learn:**
- How to write constraints and conventions
- How to enforce layer boundaries
- How to prevent common violations
- How to integrate with CI/CD pipelines

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you'll be able to:

- ✅ Write architectural policies as code
- ✅ Enforce standards automatically in CI/CD
- ✅ Prevent architectural drift before it happens
- ✅ Scale governance across large teams
- ✅ Track compliance across services

## Real-World Application

This course uses patterns from:
- **Microservices governance** at scale
- **Multi-team architecture** standards
- **Compliance requirements** (HIPAA, SOC 2)
- **Service boundary enforcement**
- **Dependency management** policies
