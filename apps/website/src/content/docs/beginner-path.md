# Beginner Path: Learn Sruja Without Overwhelm

Follow this small-steps plan. Each step has a clear outcome, takes 10–30 minutes, and gives immediate feedback.

## Step 1: Getting Started (20–30 min)
- Read: [/docs/getting-started](/docs/getting-started)
- Outcome: CLI installed, first model created

## Step 2: CLI Basics (20 min)
- Tutorial: [/tutorials/basic/cli-basics](/tutorials/basic/cli-basics)
- Outcome: Run lint, fmt, tree, export

## Step 3: DSL Basics (25–30 min)
- Tutorial: [/tutorials/basic/dsl-basics](/tutorials/basic/dsl-basics)
- Quiz: [/quizzes/dsl-basics](/quizzes/dsl-basics)
- Outcome: Understand systems, containers, components, relations

## Step 4: Validation & Linting (15–20 min)
- Tutorial: [/tutorials/basic/validation-linting](/tutorials/basic/validation-linting)
- Challenge: [/challenges/missing-relations](/challenges/missing-relations)
- Outcome: Fix common modeling errors

## Step 5: Export Diagrams (15–20 min)
- Tutorial: [/tutorials/basic/export-diagrams](/tutorials/basic/export-diagrams)
- Outcome: Generate diagrams (D2, SVG) and Markdown

## Step 6: Practice Micro‑Challenges (20–30 min)
- Challenges: 
  - [/challenges/add-component](/challenges/add-component)
  - [/challenges/fix-relations](/challenges/fix-relations)
  - [/challenges/queue-worker](/challenges/queue-worker)
