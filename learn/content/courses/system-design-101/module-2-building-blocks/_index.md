# Module 2: Building Blocks

A distributed system is built from several key components. In this module, we will explore the most common building blocks and how to use them effectively.

## Lessons

1.  [Load Balancers]({{< relref "lesson-1" >}})
    *   Distributing traffic across multiple servers.
2.  [Databases]({{< relref "lesson-2" >}})
    *   Choosing between SQL and NoSQL, and scaling data.
3.  [Caching]({{< relref "lesson-3" >}})
    *   Improving performance with in-memory data stores.
