# Module 3: Advanced Modeling

As systems grow, they often evolve from simple monoliths into complex distributed architectures. In this module, we will explore how to model these advanced patterns.

## Lessons

1.  [Microservices Architecture]({{< relref "lesson-1" >}})
    *   Decomposing monoliths into independent services.
2.  [Event-Driven Architecture]({{< relref "lesson-2" >}})
    *   Decoupling services with asynchronous messaging.
3.  [Dynamic Views vs User Journeys]({{< relref "lesson-3" >}})
    *   Runtime views of static models vs High-level user stories.
