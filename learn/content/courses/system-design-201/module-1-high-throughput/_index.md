# Module 1: High-Throughput Systems

In this module, we focus on systems that need to handle a massive number of requests per second with low latency.

## Lessons

1.  [Design a URL Shortener]({{< relref "lesson-1" >}})
    *   **TinyURL**: Handling high read/write ratios and redirection.
2.  [Design a Rate Limiter]({{< relref "lesson-2" >}})
    *   **Protection**: Preventing abuse and managing traffic spikes.
