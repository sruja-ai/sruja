# Module 7: Governance, Security & Compliance

In the enterprise world, "it works" isn't enough. It must be secure, compliant, and cost-effective.

In this final module, we will:
1.  **Secure**: Use Policies to enforce security standards (e.g., Encryption).
2.  **Optimize**: Track and control infrastructure costs.
3.  **Comply**: Prepare for a SOC 2 audit using Sruja as evidence.
