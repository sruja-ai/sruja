# Lesson 3: Audit Readiness (SOC 2)

Congratulations! You are now big enough to need a SOC 2 audit. The auditor asks: "Show me your system diagram and prove that all changes are reviewed."

## Sruja as Evidence
Instead of scrambling to draw a whiteboard diagram, you point them to your Sruja repository.

1.  **Current State**: The generated diagram is always up to date.
2.  **Change History**: Git history shows every architectural change, who made it, and who approved it (via Pull Request).
3.  **Controls**: Your `policy` files prove that you have automated checks for security and compliance.

## The End
You have built a scalable, secure, and compliant e-commerce platform. And you did it with a blueprint.

**Happy Architecting!**
