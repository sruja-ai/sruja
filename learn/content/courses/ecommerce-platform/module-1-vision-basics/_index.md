# Module 1: The Vision & The Basics

Before we write a single line of code or define a single component, we need to understand *what* we are building and *why*.

In this module, we will:
1.  Define the high-level requirements for our E-Commerce Platform.
2.  Set up our Sruja workspace.
3.  Create our first "Hello World" architecture diagram.
