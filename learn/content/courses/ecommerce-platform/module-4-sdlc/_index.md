# Module 4: The Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

Architecture isn't static; it lives and breathes with your code. In this module, we will see how Sruja integrates into your daily workflow.

We will cover:
1.  **The Local Loop**: How to work with Sruja on your machine.
2.  **Environments**: Modeling Dev, Staging, and Production.
3.  **CI/CD**: Automating architectural validation.
