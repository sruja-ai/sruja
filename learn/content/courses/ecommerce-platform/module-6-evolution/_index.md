# Module 6: Evolution & Scaling

Your startup succeeded! Now you have 10x the traffic and 10x the engineers. The architecture that worked yesterday won't work tomorrow.

In this module, we will:
1.  **Scale Up**: Handle traffic spikes by refactoring our architecture.
2.  **Clean Up**: Manage technical debt without stopping feature work.
