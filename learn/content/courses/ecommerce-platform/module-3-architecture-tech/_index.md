# Module 3: Architecture & Technology Choices

We have our business domains. Now we need to decide *how* to build them.

In this module, we will:
1.  **Make the Decision**: Should we build a monolith or microservices? (Hint: It's not always microservices).
2.  **Choose the Tech**: Go vs Node? Postgres vs Mongo?
3.  **Define Contracts**: How will our services talk to each other?
