# Module 5: Operations, Reliability & Performance

Building the system is half the battle. Running it at scale is the other half.

In this module, we will:
1.  **Deploy Safely**: Using Blue/Green and Canary deployments.
2.  **Debug Structurally**: Using Sruja to find the root cause of performance issues.
3.  **Observe**: Mapping logs and metrics back to our architecture.
