# Module 2: Domain-Driven Design

A great architecture reflects the business it serves. In this module, we will use **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles to break down our e-commerce monolith into manageable pieces.

We will cover:
1.  **Strategic Design**: Identifying the core domains (Order Management, Inventory, etc.).
2.  **Tactical Design**: Modeling the data structures (Aggregates, Entities).
3.  **User Journeys**: Mapping out how users interact with these domains.
