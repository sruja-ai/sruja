# Building a Scalable E-Commerce Platform

Welcome to the advanced Sruja masterclass. In this course, we won't just learn syntax; we will build a real-world, production-grade system from scratch.

## What we will build
We will architect **"Shopify-lite"**, a multi-tenant e-commerce platform that handles:
*   **Store Management**: Users can create their own online stores.
*   **Product Catalog**: Managing inventory and variants.
*   **Checkout & Payments**: Secure transaction processing.
*   **High Traffic**: Handling Black Friday spikes.

## Why Sruja?
Building complex systems without a blueprint is a recipe for disaster. Sruja will be our **Central Nervous System** throughout this journey, helping us:
1.  **Design** the system before writing code.
2.  **Validate** our architectural decisions.
3.  **Document** the system automatically.
4.  **Govern** the evolution of the platform.

Let's get started!
