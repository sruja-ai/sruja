# About Sruja

Sruja is a developer‑friendly language for defining, visualizing, and validating software architecture. Our vision is to bring governance to architecture and assist AI‑driven development — helping individuals design with best practices and enabling companies to standardize systems with policies and standards.

## Principles

- Code‑first and practical
- Small steps, iterate fast
- Honest docs and clear errors

## Current Focus

- Parser correctness and validation rules
- Reliable D2 → SVG export
- Runnable examples with a browser‑based playground

If you want to contribute, see the [Community](/community/) page.
