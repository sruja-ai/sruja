# Codacy Ignore Patterns
# Files/patterns to ignore in Codacy analysis

# These files have documented complexity warnings that are acceptable
# See COMPLEXITY_WARNINGS.md for detailed explanations

# Note: Codacy MCP CLI may still show warnings, but these are non-blocking
# The complexity in these functions is intentional and documented:

# learn/assets/js/utils/sanitize.ts - sanitizeUrl() - Security validation (complexity: 9)
# learn/assets/js/components/Playground.tsx - handleRun() - UI handler (complexity: 9)
# learn/assets/js/components/SrujaCodeBlock.tsx - updateToolbar() - Sticky toolbar (complexity: 10)
# learn/assets/js/utils/svg-processing.ts - processCompileOutput() - Multi-format processor (complexity: 16)
