It is the bridge between business requirements and the final code.\nThe C4 Model# We use the C4 Model to visualize software architecture. It consists of four hierarchical levels:\nContext: High-level view showing the system and its interactions with users and other systems. Container: Shows the applications and data stores that make up the system. Component: Shows the internal components within a container. Code: (Optional) Shows the implementation details (classes, interfaces). Why Sruja?# Sruja is a domain-specific language (DSL) for defining software architecture as code. It allows you to:\nVersion Control: Store your architecture in Git. Validate: Ensure your design meets requirements. Visualize: Generate diagrams automatically. Collaborate: Review designs like code.

It allows you to describe your systems, containers, and components using a clean, C4-model-based DSL, and then generate diagrams, documentation, and more.\nWhy Sruja?# Code-First# Treat your architecture like code. Version control it, review it, and evolve it. Sruja files are plain text, making them easy to diff and merge. This allows you to integrate architectural decision-making into your existing development workflows (Pull Requests, Code Reviews).\nC4 Model# Built-in support for the C4 model (System, Container, Component) ensures a standardized way to describe software. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to invent your own boxes and arrows; Sruja provides the primitives you need to describe software systems at different levels of abstraction.\nDiagrams as Code# Generate beautiful diagrams (via D2) automatically from your model. No more dragging boxes around in Visio or Lucidchart. When your code changes, your diagrams update automatically. This ensures your documentation never goes stale.\nValidation# Ensure your architecture follows best practices with built-in validation rules. Sruja can check for things like:\nOrphaned elements (defined but not connected). Circular dependencies. Missing descriptions or technology tags. Compliance with architectural policies. Key Features# Simple DSL# The Sruja DSL is designed to be easy to read and write. It uses a familiar C-style syntax with braces for grouping.\nsystem \u0026#34;MySystem\u0026#34; { container \u0026#34;WebApp\u0026#34; { technology \u0026#34;Go\u0026#34; } }D2 Export# Sruja exports directly to D2, a modern diagram scripting language. D2 handles the layout and routing, producing high-quality SVG diagrams that look professional and are easy to read.\nValidation Engine# Catch architectural smells early. The validation engine runs every time you build or check your model, providing immediate feedback on the health of your architecture.\nExtensible# Built for the future. Sruja is designed to be extensible, allowing for new export formats, custom validation rules, and integration with other tools in your ecosystem.\nGetting Started# Ready to dive in? Check out the Getting Started guide to install Sruja and build your first model.\nCommunity# Join the community to discuss architecture, share models, and contribute to Sruja.\n"},{"id":32,"href":"/tutorials/","title":"Tutorials","section":"Home","content":"Tutorials# Step-by-step guides to help you master Sruja.\nBasics# Getting Started More tutorials coming soon.\n"}]
